;;; Commentary:

;; Use `edi-mode' to edit raw edi files. Here is how to do that:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.edi" . edi-mode))
;;
;; Or, if you are > Emacs version 21, you can recognize them
;; like:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'magic-mode-alist '("^ISA" . edi-mode))
;;
;; Key Bindings:
;;   C-c C-r -- convert a single line EDI file to a multi-line
;;              edi file (Readable)
;;   C-c C-e -- covert a multi-line edi file to a single line
;;              edi file (Non-readable)
;;   C-c C-c -- query for, and count the give edi segment
;;

;;; History
;;
;; 1.0.3    2007-03-09
;;  * Added nothing more than a reference to setting up via 
;;    magic-mode-alist. Many EDI files do not have a common
;;    extension.
;;
;; 1.0.2    2005-12-20
;;  * Highlights Segment Id's at begining of line as well as after a
;;    segment terminator (Christian Plate)
;;
;;  * Counts segments correctly while in EDI format (one line only).
;;
;; 1.0.1    2005-02-08
;;  * Updates for (S)XEmacs (Steve Youngs <steve@sxemacs.org>)
;;
;; 1.0.0    2004-12-10
;;  * Initial Creation
